# Conduit Connector for <!-- readmegen:name -->Box<!-- /readmegen:name -->

[Conduit](https://conduit.io) connector for <!-- readmegen:name -->Box<!-- /readmegen:name -->.

<!-- readmegen:description -->
## API Reference

* https://developer.box.com/reference

## Destination

The Box Destination takes a Conduit record and uploads it to the remote box directory.

### Create, Update and Snapshot Operations

The box destination connector uploads the records in 3 different ways.

* For a file which is <= 4MB the uploads the single record file by simple box upload endpoint.
* For a file which is >= 4MB and <= 20MB, it keeps the file records in memory and once the last
  record is appended it uploads it using the simple box upload endpoint.
* For a file which is > 20MB, it uploads the file using chunk upload endpoint. It first creates
  a new session for chunk upload which gives session id and part size in response. Using this
  session id and part size the records are then uploaded. It prepares the parts by keeping
  them in memory and upload the parts one by one using chunk upload endpoint.

### Delete Operation

Box destination connector delete a record using MetadataFileName.

## Source

A source connector pulls data from an external resource and pushes it to
downstream resources via Conduit.

## Destination

A destination connector pushes data from upstream resources to an external
resource via Conduit.

## Development

- To install the required tools, run `make install-tools`.
- To generate code (mocks, re-generate `connector.yaml`, update the README,
  etc.), run `make generate`.

## How to build?

Run `make build` to build the connector.

## Testing

Run `make test` to run all the unit tests. Run `make test-integration` to run
the integration tests.

The Docker compose file at `test/docker-compose.yml` can be used to run the
required resource locally.

## How to release?

The release is done in two steps:

- Bump the version in [connector.yaml](/connector.yaml). This can be done
  with [bump_version.sh](/scripts/bump_version.sh) script, e.g.
  `scripts/bump_version.sh 2.3.4` (`2.3.4` is the new version and needs to be a
  valid semantic version). This will also automatically create a PR for the
  change.
- Tag the connector, which will kick off a release. This can be done
  with [tag.sh](/scripts/tag.sh).
